## Installation guide of Sublime Text                   
* Step 1: Download Sublime Text 4 here: https://www.sublimetext.com/4 . Choose the approriate version with your computer's system                                                                                     
* Step 2: Open ST4, look at the menu bar (on the top) -> [Tools]  -> [Build system] -> [New Build system]
  * Or you can use the built-in build file system. Skip to step 6.                                                                                                              
* Step 3: Copy the code below and save as "myPython.sublime-build"

      {
       "target":"run_existing_window_command",
       "id":"repl_python_run",
       "file":"config/Python/Main.sublime-menu"
      }
        
* Step 4: Write some program and save it with extension .py (like: Hello_World.py)
* Step 5: [Tools]  -> [Build system] -> [New Build system] -> [myC] -> [myPython - Run]                                                                                                                                     
* Step 5: In the first time using ST4, Press [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [B] at the same time. Next time just press [Ctrl] + [B]
* Step 6: How to crack ST4. Read this: https://gist.github.com/skoqaq/3f3e8f28e23c881143cef9cf49d821ff#gistcomment-4824279
